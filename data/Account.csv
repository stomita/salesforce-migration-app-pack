Bentley in 1919 when the first Bentley engine burst into life at New Street Mews, London. From these modest beginnings, W.O's company went from strength to strength through the 1920s, with an evolving series of acclaimed motor cars and a parade of racing triumphs to prove their outstanding performance. These laurels were capped with five outright victories at Le Mans between 1924 - 1930 and a sixth in 2003.  

If we had mission statements in those days, it could not have been expressed more eloquently than in the words of W.O. himself, ""To build a good car, a fast car, the best in class"". 

These words are just as relevant today as they continue to inform our beliefs, actions and ambitions for the future. Located in Crewe, England since 1946 and owned since 1998 by Volkswagen AG, Bentley Motors is dedicated to making responsive and powerful Grand Tourers with the stamina to cross continents at pace, and drive in refined comfort and style.
